__ALGO Governance Charter:__ The instrument that shall govern the issuance of ALGO Tokens.

__Algo-Makers:__ A subset of the Community counting professional and amateur traders, developers and analysts, organized in Teams, commited to create, develop, maintain and promote the evolution of Algorithms.

__ALGO Stream:__ A concept that represents a flow of ALGO Tokens over time and the mechanism by which incentives are routed to stakeholders such as Team Members.

__ALGO Stream Supervisor:__ A Superalgos Organization official tasked with supervising the validity of ALGO Streams.

__Area of Responsibility:__ It is a defined scope of work within a domain.

The agreement with Exchanges provisions for all of the volume originating at federated nodes to be bundled and computed for additional discounts on top of the discounts each Exchange grants to individual accounts within the said Exchange. Bundled-Volume Discounts are automatically distributed back to Node Operators of federated nodes on a pro-rata basis of the volume contributed to the bundle.
